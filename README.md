# InstrumentedPIDLibrary
This is a version of a PID controller that has its inner workings fully instrumented for the outside to see what is going on.
It started with a version of [Brett Beauregard's Arduino PID Library](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library), which
was released under the MIT License. The basic funcationlity is the same, but significant changes have been made for
modernization and instrumentation.
